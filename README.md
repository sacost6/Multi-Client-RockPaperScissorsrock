# Multi-Client-RockPaperScissorsrock

## Project Summary
Rock, Paper, Scissors with two extra twists! This application implements the logic for a client-server program that handles gameplay for a variation of rock, paper, 
scissors. The client program handles input and displaying game information, but the server deals with the scorekeeping and game details. This program is written in Java
and uses sockets to connect clients and the server. I also used JavaFX to deal with the GUI portion of the application. This was the first program in which I used sockets
to create a server-client model. This program is a multiplayer version of Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock, in which you have a lobby with multiple players and are able to
invite players to a game.

## To run:
1) Download zip
2) Import to IDE and configure the settings for both the server and client programs.
3) Once the server is running, you must have two clients connect in order for the game to begin.

## Topics Learned Upon Completion
* Socket programming in Java
* Client-Server Model
* CSS Stylesheets for JavaFX
* Agile Development Methodology
